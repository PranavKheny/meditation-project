Hello, {name}, welcome to your very own meditation. We hope you {positive_affirmation_1}, {positive_affirmation_2}, and {positive_affirmation_3}. 
Let's get started with a deep breath. Please choose a comfortable seated position, and when you are ready, close your eyes if you haven't done so already. 
You are here for a {meditation_focus_1}, {meditation_focus_2}, and {meditation_focus_3} experience. 
You are here for yourself to help calm and settle your mind and body. Remember that this is your time, and you deserve this.

In stressful moments, remember to breathe deeply and evenly. This simple act can often make a world of difference in how you feel both physically and mentally. 
Now, let's take this further. Take a deep breath in and feel your lungs fill with air; hold it for a moment. Now, exhale. 
Feel the air leave your lungs, carrying any tension or stress you may be holding. Continue this pattern of deep breathing, focusing solely on the sensation of the air entering and leaving your body.

As you breathe, allow your body to relax in your chosen position. Feel the way your body sinks into the surface beneath you, supported and steady. 
Now, imagine a {visual_object}, it’s just there floating in the vastness of your mind, {object_description}. 
You don’t need to think about anything else, just this {visual_object}. 

As you breathe, picture this {visual_object_action}. It’s moving on its own, sliding effortlessly without a sound. 
You are just watching, and that’s all you need to do. As you breathe in, the {visual_object} grows slightly, and as you breathe out, it gently shrinks back to its original size. 
A peaceful, calming rhythm echoing your own breath—there’s nothing more than this {visual_object} and your own breath, and that’s enough. 
Breathe in, the {visual_object} grows. Breathe out, the {visual_object} shrinks. Let this simple image soothe you, calm you, and ground you.

Softly repeat this affirmation to yourself or say it quietly in your mind: {affirmation}. 
Let these words sink into you, filling you with a sense of {emotion_1} and {emotion_2}. 
Continue to focus on your breath and the {visual_object}. {affirmation}. The {visual_object}, like your breath, continues to ebb and flow, growing and shrinking. 
There is a powerful tranquility in this simplicity. You are doing well, you are calming your mind and grounding your body.

Remember, {name}, in this simplicity, there is power. You have the ability to {self_ability}. 
You have the ability to affirm that you are {affirmation_outcome}. 

The guided meditation is coming to an end now, but feel free to stay in this quiet place and relax.
